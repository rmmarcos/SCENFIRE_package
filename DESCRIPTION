Description: SCENFIRE is a specialized selection algorithm designed to align simulated 
  fire perimeters with specific fire size distribution scenarios. The foundation of this 
  approach lies in generating a vast collection of plausible simulated fires across a wide 
  range of conditions, assuming a random pattern of ignition. 
  The algorithm then assembles individual fire perimeters based on their specific probabilities 
  of occurrence, e.g., determined by (i) the likelihood of ignition and (ii) the probability of 
  particular fire-weather scenarios, including wind speed and direction.
