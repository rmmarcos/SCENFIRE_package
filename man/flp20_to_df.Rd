\title{Convert FLP20 file to a data frame}
\usage{
flp20_to_df(file)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{A character string specifying the path to the FLP20 .csv file.}
}
\value{
A data frame with reshaped data, including `name` (original FIL column index)
  and `FL` (calculated flame length).
}
\description{
Reads a .csv file, typically an FLP20 output from FConstMTT, for single fire event simulation,
and reshapes the data to long format, calculating flame length (FL) from `FIL` columns.
`PBurn` is expected to be 1 for individual fires, and `FIL` columns are binary (1 or 0).
}
\examples{
# Create a dummy FLP20 CSV file representing individual fires
# Each row is a unique fire event at a specific XPos, YPos.
# PBurn is 1, and only one FIL column is 1 for the flame length category.
temp_flp20_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".csv")
dummy_data <- data.frame(
  XPos = c(10, 20, 10, 30),
  YPos = c(10, 20, 20, 10),
  PBurn = c(1, 1, 1, 1), # PBurn set to 1 for individual fires
  FIL1 = c(1, 0, 0, 0),  # Fire 1 is in FL bin 1 (0.25)
  FIL2 = c(0, 1, 0, 0),  # Fire 2 is in FL bin 2 (0.75)
  FIL3 = c(0, 0, 1, 0),  # Fire 3 is in FL bin 3 (1.25)
  FIL4 = c(0, 0, 0, 1)   # Fire 4 is in FL bin 4 (1.75)
  # FIL5 to FIL20 would be 0 for these examples
)
write.csv(dummy_data, temp_flp20_file, row.names = FALSE)

# Process the dummy file
df_result <- flp20_to_df(temp_flp20_file)
print(head(df_result))

# Expected output for first few rows after processing:
# XPos YPos PBurn name    value   FL
# 1   10   10     1    1       1 0.25
# 2   20   20     1    2       1 0.75
# 3   10   20     1    3       1 1.25
# 4   30   10     1    4       1 1.75

# Clean up the dummy file
