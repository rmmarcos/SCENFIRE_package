\usage{
get_select_params(fires_hist_size, sim_perimeters_size, n_years)

get_select_params(fires_hist_size, sim_perimeters_size, n_years)
}
\arguments{
\item{fires_hist_size}{Numeric vector of historical fire sizes.}

\item{sim_perimeters_size}{Numeric vector of simulated fire sizes.}

\item{n_years}{Integer. Number of years considered in the historical dataset.}
}
\value{
An integer representing the ratio of total simulated area to the
  annual average historical area. This value can be interpreted as the
  maximum number of historical fire "equivalents" that can be formed from
  the simulated data.

An integer value representing the ratio between the total simulated area
and the average annual historical burned area.
Larger values indicate that the simulation covers several historical fire seasons.
}
\description{
Calculates a parameter for event selection based on the total area of
historical fires (normalized by number of years) and the total area of
simulated fire perimeters. This parameter can be used to determine a
maximum surface threshold for selecting a subset of simulated events.

This function calculates a selection parameter that represents how many times
the simulated burned area covers, on average, the historical annual burned area.
}
\details{
The parameter is calculated as:
\deqn{ \text{param} = \left\lfloor \frac{\sum(\text{sim\_perimeters\_size})}{\sum(\text{fires\_hist\_size}) / n\_years} \right\rfloor }

Where:
\itemize{
  \item \eqn{\sum(\text{fires\_hist\_size}) / n\_years} = average historical burned area per year.
  \item \eqn{\sum(\text{sim\_perimeters\_size})} = total simulated burned area.
}
}
\examples{
# Calculate selection parameter for a scenario where simulated data
# covers 10 times the annual historical area.
get_select_params(fires_hist_size = c(100, 500, 1000),
                  sim_perimeters_size = c(1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000),
                  n_years = 1)

# If historical data represents 10 years
get_select_params(fires_hist_size = c(100, 500, 1000),
                  sim_perimeters_size = c(1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000),
                  n_years = 10)

# Example with toy data
hist_sizes <- c(100, 200, 150, 300)
sim_sizes  <- c(80, 120, 200, 250, 300)

get_select_params(fires_hist_size = hist_sizes,
                  sim_perimeters_size = sim_sizes,
                  n_years = 4)
