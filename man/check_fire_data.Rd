\title{Check fire data for sufficiency}
\usage{
check_fire_data(fires_hist_size, sim_perimeters_size, n_years)

check_fire_data(fires_hist_size, sim_perimeters_size, n_years)
}
\arguments{
\item{fires_hist_size}{Numeric vector of historical fire sizes.}

\item{sim_perimeters_size}{Numeric vector of simulated fire sizes.}

\item{n_years}{Integer. Number of years represented in the simulation.}
}
\value{
If simulated data is sufficient, returns an integer representing a
  recommended surface threshold (typically 10% of the maximum possible threshold).
  Otherwise, returns `NULL` (invisibly, as it only prints messages) if
  simulated data is deemed insufficient.

If the simulated fires are sufficient, returns an integer representing
the recommended surface threshold (in number of seasons).
If the simulations are not sufficient, prints diagnostic messages
and returns nothing.
}
\description{
This function assesses whether the available simulated fire perimeters are
sufficient in terms of maximum fire size and total burned area, relative
to historical fire data. It provides messages to the user if deficiencies
are found and, if data is sufficient, calculates and recommends a surface
threshold for selecting events.

This function compares historical fire sizes with simulated fire sizes
to assess whether the simulations are sufficient in terms of
maximum burned area and total burned area.
If the simulated fires are not adequate, the function prints guidance
messages suggesting additional simulations or adjustments.
}
\details{
The function checks:
\itemize{
  \item Maximum fire size in historical vs. simulated data.
  \item Total burned area in historical vs. simulated data.
}

If both criteria are satisfied, it calculates a recommended threshold
using \code{\link{get_select_params}}.

# Example 1: Simulated fires are too small and not enough area
check_fire_data(fires_hist_size = c(100, 500, 1000, 2000),
                sim_perimeters_size = c(10, 50, 80, 120),
                n_years = 1)

# Example 2: Simulated fires are sufficient
check_fire_data(fires_hist_size = c(100, 500, 1000, 2000),
                sim_perimeters_size = c(10, 50, 80, 120, 500, 1500, 2500, 5000),
                n_years = 1)

# Example 3: Insufficient area, but max size is okay
check_fire_data(fires_hist_size = c(100, 500, 1000, 2000),
                sim_perimeters_size = c(10, 50, 80, 120, 500, 1500),
                n_years = 10)
# Example 4: Correct data
check_fire_data(fires_hist_size = c(1, 5, 10, 600),
               sim_perimeters_size = c(10, 50, 80, 120, 500, 2500),
