\title{Function to obtain the target histogram}
\usage{
build_target_hist(num_bins = 20, l = T, sizes)
}
\arguments{
\item{num_bins}{Integer. The desired number of bins for the histogram (default: 20).}

\item{l}{Logical. If `TRUE`, a logarithmic transformation (`log(sizes + 1e-6)`)
is applied to `sizes`. If `FALSE`, the original scale is used. This parameter
influences both the distribution transformation and the binning.}

\item{sizes}{Numeric vector. The fire sizes (e.g., area in hectares) from the
data used to build the target distribution.}
}
\value{
A list containing two elements:
  \describe{
    \item{target_hist}{A numeric vector representing the density values of the target histogram.}
    \item{bins}{A numeric vector specifying the breakpoints (edges) of the bins used in the histogram.}
  }
}
\description{
This function builds a histogram (specifically, its density) from a set of
fire sizes, which is intended to represent a target distribution (e.g., from
historical fire events). It allows for an optional logarithmic transformation
of the fire sizes before binning and determines bin breakpoints dynamically.
}
\examples{
# Example historical fire sizes (replace with your actual data)
historical_fire_sizes <- c(10, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 5000)

# Note: 'event_surfaces' is used internally in the function without being passed as an argument.
# For this example to be self-contained, we define it here, but in a package context,
# ensure 'event_surfaces' is either a globally available variable or properly managed.
event_surfaces <- c(5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95) # Dummy data for example

# Build a target histogram using logarithmic transformation
target_log_hist <- build_target_hist(num_bins = 10, l = TRUE, sizes = historical_fire_sizes)
print("Logarithmic Target Histogram:")
print(target_log_hist$target_hist)
print(target_log_hist$bins)

# Build a target histogram using the original scale
target_linear_hist <- build_target_hist(num_bins = 10, l = FALSE, sizes = historical_fire_sizes)
print("Linear Target Histogram:")
print(target_linear_hist$target_hist)
print(target_linear_hist$bins)
